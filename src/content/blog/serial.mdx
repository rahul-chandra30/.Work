# A Week of Progress: Backend Sync and Frontend Updates

This past week has been a whirlwind of activity for our team. With the sprint in full swing, we’ve tackled bugs, synced up on backend priorities, and made strides on the frontend redesign. Here’s a rundown of what went down, complete with the highs, lows, and everything in between.

## Syncing Up and Solving Problems

Our week kicked off with a key meeting to align the backend team.

Meeting: Prathamesh, Rahul, 4-5 PM, Backend Sync, Resolved Issues

It was a productive hour—Prathamesh and Rahul hashed out some lingering API concerns, and we left with a clear plan to address them. This set the tone for a focused sprint. 

Of course, not everything went smoothly. We hit a snag mid-week that slowed us down.

Blocker: API downtime, Prathamesh

The API outage threw a wrench in our testing schedule, but Prathamesh flagged it early, and we pivoted to other tasks while the ops team sorted it out.

## Tasks in Motion

On the development front, Rahul’s been grinding away at a pesky login issue.

Task: Fix login bug, Rahul, In Progress

It’s not fully resolved yet, but Rahul’s making steady headway. We’re hoping to wrap this up before the sprint ends.

Meanwhile, I’ve taken on a smaller but necessary chore.

ActionItem: Update README, Rahul, 2025-03-20

The README’s been overdue for a refresh, and I’ve committed to getting it done by Thursday. It’s a small win, but it’ll keep our docs in sync with the codebase.

## Team Updates and Milestones

Friday’s stand-up gave us a chance to take stock.

The team reported that the API issues were finally behind us, thanks to some overnight heroics from the ops crew. It was a morale boost heading into the weekend.

On the frontend, we’re seeing real progress too.

Progress: Planning, 45%, Waiting on feedback

Progress: Frontend redesign, 55%, Waiting on feedback

Progress: API checks are done, 90%, Waiting on feedback

The new design is about three-quarters done. We’ve got a solid prototype, but it’s on hold until the design team weighs in. Fingers crossed they love it as much as we do!

## A Quick Tip

Here’s something we learned the hard way this week.

Callout: tip, Test this locally first

Before pushing anything API-related, test it locally. That downtime could’ve been less painful if we’d caught it sooner.

## Code in Action

Speaking of testing, here’s a snippet Rahul used to debug the login issue.

CodeSnippet: javascript, console.log('Hello');

Okay, it’s not the actual fix (that’s still in progress!), but it’s a reminder to keep logging and checking as you go. Sometimes the simplest tools get you through.

## Visual Progress

Finally, here’s a peek at where the frontend’s headed.

It’s shaping up nicely, right? Once we get that feedback, we’ll polish it up and ship it.

This week showed what we’re capable of when we pull together—glitches and all. Next up, we’ll wrap up these tasks and start prepping for the deployment push. Stay tuned!
